# Abstract 

<p3>The detection of Grape Leaves diseases plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and productivity of vineyards. In this research, a novel approach combining machine learning and deep learning techniques with image processing is proposed for accurate and efficient disease detection. The study utilizes a large dataset of grape leaf images, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification. Additionally, image processing methods are employed to preprocess the images, enhancing the model's performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving high accuracy and providing a promising solution for automated and early detection of Grape Leaves diseases in vineyards.</p3>
